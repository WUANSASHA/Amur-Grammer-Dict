**1 A brief Summary of Grammar** 

Let's cut the crap and get down to business. 

Actually, the words are derived from Orok, Evenki and Bala language mostly.

To make a long story short,



​    **Tense & main suffixes** 

•Loanwords of English or others language usually end with -o, -ombi, or -hadaa

•Native words end with -mbi(-ha, -ra, -me, -ngge), -daa, or -hanaa



​    -ha means did sth (Simple Past)
​    -ra means will do sth (Simple Future)
​    -me means doing sth (Present Continuous)

"verbs -suffix" -fi means the connecting form of verbs in Amur (It just like the Rentaikei or Renyoukei in Japanese)

​    -guoya means doing sth (It is present continuous tense, too. But usually used for subjective judgment)

The above content are called "tense ¹" in grammar of Amur.



​    naa-, it's a prefix, means "have done". In Amur, prefix is rare. Then it extracted two auxiliary verbs for perfect tense. (result from на) 

​    This part is called "tense ²" in our grammar, As follows:

​        ～bayinaa, it's usage is similar to the function of "have" in English. For set up a past perfect tense or future perfect tense. (result from байх + на)

​        ~ bolonaa, it's usage is similar to the function of "be" in English. For set up a past continuous tense or future continuous tense. (result from болох + на)



Their prefixes and suffixes order of verbs is as follows: "affix - prefix - verb - motion - negative - attitude - tense ¹ - tense ² - affix - voice mood", in general.



​    **About prepositions and motion** 

-Ene- means "to do", and -ji- means "come to do", -ge- means "go to do". They can be suffixes or prepositions. If it were a suffix, the form should be verb+enembi or verb+jimbi, verb+gembi.

Kachi means middle voice (do sth together), it is a preposition.

Jini means "with", it's usually treated a prep, it is a preposition.

Bin means "by", it points the tools or ways in a sentence, it is a preposition.

  waka- means don't do sth, it is a prefix.
  -muro also means not or be not
  -mutie means can not do sth or could not do sth



​    **About word formation and derivation**

Derivational Morphology often involves the addition of a derivational suffix or other affix. 

Here are examples of Amur derivational patterns and their suffixes:

​    • nouns + ngga will be changed into adjectives 
​    This is one of the most commonly used methods. e.g. danger -> dangerous in English

​    • nouns + keqi will be also changed into adjectives or adverbs 
​    It usually means "as...as..." or "just like sth". 
​    e.g. bird -> birdlike in English or hero -> heroic in English (meaning: 鸟 -> 像鸟一样的；英雄 -> 英雄般的)

​    • verbs + ngge will be changed into nouns
​    This is one of the most commonly used methods. e.g. mean -> meaning in English

​    • nouns + lambi or lembi will be changed into verbs 
​    This is one of the most commonly used methods. e.g. glory -> glorify in English
​    It just like "する" in Japanese or "hada" in Korean.

​    • verbs + hiya or kiya will be changed into nouns or adjectives. And verbs + gan will be changed into nouns, too.
​    But the function about "-hiya" or "-kiya" is undefined, Until now. So, why this suffix is there and what it might do was unknown.
​    e.g. agree -> agreement in English (by the suffix -gan)

In fact, according to my survey, 90% of verbs which end with "-hiya or -kiya", that word often is an adjunct of a noun. Or as a special pronoun in the sentence.
e.g. 走 -> 走着的 or 那个走着的(人) in Chinese, perhaps same as "verb -ed" in English, too.

​    • adjectives and adverbs + hiya or kiya will be changed into verbs 
​    It means "let it be a state" or "bring it into a state". 
​    e.g. bright -> brighten in English (meaning: 明亮的 -> 使变亮)

​    • adjectives and adverbs + sun or gisun will be changed into nouns 
​    e.g. happy -> happiness in English



​    **About word order** 

This is a strategy called double syntax.

Word order is one of important means of grammar in Amur language.

Pay attention to grammar, and aviod to use the Chinese word order to express sentences of Amur language.

Which word order is chosen in applying language rest with particular circumstantial.

The normal word order in Amur sentences is Subject-Object-Verb. However, other orders are possible, depending on discourse-oriented considerations such as emphasis. Adjectives precede the words they modify. 

All in all, the S-O-V or the O-S-V is usual, but the S-V-O is acceptable, too. 



​    **Others** 

•Loanwords of Russian often end with -a(-va) and -jimbi

•Foreign words and Alien words often end with -tl, -jk or null



**1.1 Link verb & Being verb**

•bimbi can be an auxiliary verb for adjectives, adverbs and nouns. Just like the function of "be" in "be beautiful".

•inu or inuya or ya all means "be(是)", easo means there "have" sth, and iso means sth "be there" or "at(在;存在)" somewhere.

•The copula "inu(or inuya, ya)" springs from the nature of the notion, to be self-identical even in parting with its own.

•werden means "become(变成)".

•uwu, also is a auxiliary verb, means "exist", uwu + nouns (in object case) means "have sth", uwu + nouns (in position case) means "sth at somewhere". (result from У)



**1.2 Case Particle** 

  -ni or -ø means case of subject (it's usually omitted)  #主格
  -be(-by) or -mo or -uo means case of object  #宾格
  -ja means case of indirect object (dative)  #间接宾格
  -deé means case of position  #位格
  -i or -ni or -nggi means case of genitive  #属格
  -ci or -tiki means case of beginning  #起始格
  -deri or -duli means case of target  #目的格 
  -vi or -yylyy means reflexive, e.g. itself or myself in English  #反身
  -i(-yi) or -di means case of instrument  #工具格/经过格
  -ina or -guna means case of accompany (CONJ-COORD, for selecting)  #与格[选择]

  -ergi means towards sth, I thinked (more on this below)  #方向格

If in S-V-O word order, The distinctions of nominative and accusative in nouns are realized by word order, with the one before the verb as the nominative and the one after it as the accusative. But the changes go further than that. Case particles still should to be added in general.

At the last, some words maybe end with -rgi(-ergi), I think it would be the case of towards sb or sth. It indicates the direction of movement, Just like 向西 or 向北 in Chinese.

Their suffixes order of nouns is as follows: "article - adjectives - noun - formation - plural - case - affix".

​    **Note:**

  -de, This is an all-purpose suffix for case particle in Amur.

  haben- is a prefix in Amur, that means "make sb/sth done", maybe just like "把" or "将" in Chinese. And it is used to emphasize the disposition of object in sentence. (result from habe in Germany.)

  Sein- is prefix in Amur, too. That meaning is "be done", same as "被" in Chinese. It is used to emphasize the disposition of subject in sentence. (result from sei in Germany.)

**1.4 Idiomatic Expressions** 

Almost all idiomatic expressions are colloquial language.

These idioms have long been established in the Amur language. And there are many Amur idioms that cannot be rendered into other languages.

**1.5 Alphabet** 

The first Amur text, A script based on the latin alphabet was used. Then a new Cyrillic-based alphabet was developed, too.

    a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z

As said before, some symbols and special characters can make our content confusing and difficult to read. And it's very difficult to type. Using digraphs is the most popular usage in Amur community.

Here are some variant letters and diagrams in the list. The letter ā or ý is only used for inherent words of Amur language.

• A line:  a in star  (without diacritical marks: aa)  -> ā
• E line:  ea in pear  (without diacritical marks: ee, ae, ea)  -> ê or é or æ or eé  (ALT+0233)
• I or Y line:  u in tsunami  (without diacritical marks: v, eu, y)  -> ı or ý 
• U line:  ü in über  (without diacritical marks: yy, wi)  -> ü  (ALT+0252)
• O line:  ir in girl  (without diacritical marks: oe, eo, e)  -> œ
• R line:  r in read  (without diacritical marks: rr, rh, 7, rw)  -> ŕ
• L line:  r in hear  (without diacritical marks: l, r, hl, rl)  and  ll in spell (without diacritical marks: ll, 2)  -> ľ and ļ
• Z line:  z in zebra  (without diacritical marks: zz, rz, sz, 3)
• T line:  th in teeth  (without diacritical marks: th, ghw)
• G line:  γ  (without diacritical marks: ' , 0)

So we usually replace special letters with numbers or diagrams in online chat.

The most frequently used special letters are ı, œ, æ, ľ and γ. And they are only used for loanwords which from English, in general.

р  -  ľ  , ъ  -  '/  ,лл  -  ll  , ә(or ээ)  -  e/œ  , зж  -  zz

There are some letters in Cyrillic script. This means that we can get some Cyrillic letters and replace them directly to some Latin letters. Mongolia and Russia, based on the use of Cyrillic alphabet text. It contained Russian letters with a few additional symbols to represent Amur sounds not found in Russian. And it seems like the Dungan language alphabet.

The alphabet consists of Russian letters one plus 3 additional letters: җ, ә, ү(or ў). There is one-to-one correspondence between sounds and letters.

  • Emu is a indifinte article, it means "one" or "a" in Amur language. 

Capitalize all proper nouns but not the articles (a, an) that precede them. The article is really a difficult concept to grasp when you have no base knowledge of it.

Always add the appropriate articles in front of the noun. But we cannot put a or the in front of names. Notice the word, if it were a proper noun, so no article is needed.

In fact, witness system of language is a very rare phenomenon in the world. This is one of Amur essential characteristics.



**4 Afterword** 

Regional accents are still acceptable but there is to be a blitz on incorrect grammar.

There is nothing in the rules of grammar to suggest that ending a sentence with a preposition is wrong.

There are always a lot of exceptions to grammar rules.

This article explains grammar simply and clearly. And this article maybe will give you a firm grasp of Amur grammar.

Is English or Chinese an official language in your country? If so, you should have no problem with studying Amur language. 

Single words are the building blocks of language. There are so many loanwords from English or Esperanto. I often teach my children English as a second language at home. That'll be most helpful. And there are a lot of common words in Amur language that came from Chinese characters, too.

You don't rush, more can't three days fishing two days the net, as far as possible let yourself slow down.

In fact, We often talked ungrammatically but fluently. 

Don't worry too much about the grammar of Amur. When we dread something, we put it off — but instead, if we can learn to enjoy it, it won’t be as hard or dreadful.

And, for what it's worth, that's my Summer Holiday message to you, my kids.

Enjoying it! Have fun!

Esperanto is used internationally across language boundaries by at least 1 million people, particularly in specialized fields.

**5  The latent function of socializing** 

Just like Amur, same language can be used to encrypt and decrypt the messages exchanged among them. Furthermore, the language should be niche, fringe and little-known, as far as possible.

For further protection, we intend to encrypt all data. Encrypt your source and data where you can. When everything works, chose your language to use encryption.



“
Globally, knowing more than one language is viewed as an asset and even a necessity in many areas.

I'm opposed to censorship in any shape or form. These censorship laws of Eastern Vietnam will turn the clock back about 50 years. It's also what makes contemporary surveillance systems so scary. I value my privacy.

Don't you see that the whole AIM of censorship is to narrow the range of thought? Excuse me for my abrupt question. But the whole story is nothing but silly, stupid nonsense.

In addition, for example, Apple's emerging global brand is privacy; it has staked its corporate reputation on limiting the sort of mass surveillance.

We must never undervalue freedom. The Freedom of speech is being realized in a roundabout way. I am enjoying our new-found freedom.
